An old style white cake, the recipe was given to me from my grand mother. She used to prepare this cake in the 1940s and still makes one from time to time. Easy to bake.

Pre-heat you oven at 375 degres and prepare a small cake pan or cup cake pan.

Ingredients.
2 eggs
1 cup of sugar
2 tea spoons of vanilla extract
1 cup of flour
1 & 1/2 tea spoon of baking powder
1/2 tea spoon of salt
1/2 cup of Milk
2 table spoons of butter.

Start by mixing the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a big bowl. 
Next warm up the butter and milk in a pan or microwave until the butter is melted.
Mix in the butter and milk to the dry stuff in the big bowl.
In a small bowl, beat and mix the 2 eggs and the vanilla.
Mix in the eggs and vanilla to the rest until everything is smooth.

Pour the mix in cake pan and place in over for 15 to 20 minutes.

Enjoy.
