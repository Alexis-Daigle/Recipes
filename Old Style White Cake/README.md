# An old style white cake

## The recipe was given to me from my grand mother. She used to prepare this cake in the 1940s and still makes it from time to time. Easy to bake.

Pre-heat you oven at 375 degres and prepare a small cake pan or cup cake pan.

## Ingredients:

- 2 tea spoons of vanilla extract
- 1 cup of flour
- 1 & 1/2 tea spoon of baking powder
- 1/2 tea spoon of salt
- 1/2 cup of Milk
- 2 table spoons of butter.

1. Start by mixing the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a big bowl.
2. Warm up the butter and milk in a pan or microwave until the butter is melted.
    (Microwave: around 40 seconds on high)
3. In a small bowl, beat and mix the 2 eggs and the vanilla.
4. Add the eggs and Vanilla to the Flour mix. 
5. Mix in the butter and milk in small increments until everything is mixed well.
