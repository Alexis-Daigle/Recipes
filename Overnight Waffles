Ingredients

1 1/3 cups milk
1 stick of butter (non salted)
2 cups of all purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon of rapid rise yeast
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Begin by melting the stick of butter in a sauce pan over medium low heat. Add the milk once melted.

Mix the yeast, flour, salt and sugar in a big bowl.

Once the milk and butter is warm, mix it with the flour/yeast mix.

After everything is well mixed together, wisk the eggs and vanilla together and add it to the mix.

After getting a consistant mix, scrape the sides of the bowl to make sure nothing is left unmixed, Add cling film to the top of the bowl and place in the refrigerator overnight.

Best used after beeing in the fridge for 12 to 24 hours.

Serve with Maple Sirup!
