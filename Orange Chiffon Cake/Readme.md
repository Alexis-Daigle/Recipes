🟠 Why orange chiffon cake?

    Beginner-friendly: The citrus juice and zest make it forgiving in flavor and texture.

    Naturally moist: Thanks to the juice and oil in the batter.

    Bright flavor: It’s refreshing, not too sweet, and pairs well with whipped cream or just plain.

🍊 Easy Orange Chiffon Cake Recipe (basic overview)
Ingredients:

    1 cup cake flour (or all-purpose flour sifted with a bit of cornstarch)

    1 tsp baking powder

    1/4 tsp salt

    1/2 cup sugar (divided: 1/4 for yolks, 1/4 for whites)

    3 eggs, separated

    1/4 cup vegetable oil

    1/4 cup fresh orange juice

    1 tbsp orange zest

    1/4 tsp cream of tartar (optional, helps with meringue)

Basic Steps:

    Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Don’t grease your pan!

    Whisk yolks + sugar + oil + juice + zest until smooth.

    Sift in flour, baking powder, salt—mix until just combined.

    Beat egg whites (with cream of tartar if using) until soft peaks. Add sugar gradually until stiff peaks.

    Fold whites into yolk mixture in 3 parts, gently.

    Pour into pan (tube or round pan). Smooth the top.

    Bake for about 45–50 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean.

    Invert pan to cool (upside down, to keep it airy).

    Once cooled, loosen with a knife and serve!
