## Bread Attempt 1,


# Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1 stick of butter (non salted)
- 3.5 cups of all purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons of sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoon of rapid rise yeast
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Begin by melting the stick of butter in a sauce pan over medium low heat. Add the milk once melted.

Mix the yeast, flour, salt and sugar in a big bowl.

Once the milk and butter is warm, mix it with the flour/yeast mix.

After everything is well mixed together, wisk the eggs and vanilla together and add it to the mix.

After getting a consistant mix, scrape the sides of the bowl to make sure nothing is left unmixed, Add cling film to the top of the bowl and leave it resting on the counter for same day use or in the fridge if you want it to be ready in the morning.

### To be continued.

I noticed the waffle recipe was very close to being bread like. I modified it a bit to see if I could make a decent bread with it.
